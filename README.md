# OPS445 Lab 4 - Lists and File Input & Output

Welcome to OPS445 Lab 4!

In this lab, you will continue developing your Python programming skills by working with lists and practicing file input/output (I/O) operations. These skills are essential for handling collections of data and interacting with external files.

📚 Lab Objectives:
Learn how to create and manipulate lists in Python
Practice common list operations:
  Indexing
  Slicing
  Iterating with loops
Understand how to read from and write to files using Python’s built-in functions
Combine lists and file I/O to process and store data
Strengthen debugging skills by handling errors related to file operations

📂 Lab Files:
You will create and work with the following files during this lab:
lab4a.py – Basic list creation and manipulation
lab4b.py – Iterating through lists with loops
lab4c.py – Reading data from files
lab4d.py – Writing data to files
lab4e.py – Combining lists and file I/O

🧩 Tips & Tricks:
Use len() to quickly check the size of a list.
Remember that list indices start at 0 in Python.
Always close files after reading or writing, or use the with open(...) context manager.
Test your file paths carefully to avoid “file not found” errors.
Keep your code modular—separate list logic from file-handling logic for clarity.
